# Governance

FSM Governance Engine uses a lightweight maintainer model.

## Roles

- Maintainer: Oleg Surkov (info@indrasnet.ee)

## Decision process

- Technical changes are proposed via issues or pull requests.
- The maintainer has final decision authority.
- Significant design changes should include rationale and tests.

## Scope boundaries

The project is validation-only. Proposals that introduce execution, automation,
or side effects will be rejected.
