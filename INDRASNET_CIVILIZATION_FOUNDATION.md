# IndrasNet Civilization Foundation

### Evolutionary Phases

The phases MVP → Audit → Post-grant represent evolutionary epochs. Each phase:

- expands the ontology,
- strengthens the self-correcting mechanisms,
- introduces new forms of collective intelligence,
- preserves the architectural invariants.

The evolution of IndrasNet is a formally defined process, not chaotic development.

### Archaeological Memory

Deprecated PDA entries preserve:

- historical mistakes,
- past compromises,
- previous architectural choices.

These entries form an archaeological layer of the civilization, not discarded trash.

### Scientific Conclusion

IndrasNet is a cryptographically defined civilization: a distributed system where the ontology of the world, the political structure, and the role of artificial intelligence are codified as immutable architectural invariants that are enforced by CI and realized through the PDA model.

This model makes IndrasNet the first system where:

- the protocol ontology equals a formal constitution,
- AI becomes a subject with cryptographic jurisdiction,
- the PDA model defines the structure of reality,
- CI acts as a mechanism of constitutional control,
- evolution unfolds as a phased model of civilizational development.
